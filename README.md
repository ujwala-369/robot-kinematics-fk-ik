Implementation of Forward and Inverse Kinematics in Python with basic ROS2/Turtleism simulation.
# Robot Kinematics and TurtleSim Simulation

This repository contains my work completed as part of the technical recruitment process for the Robotech Automation SIG at NITK Surathkal.

The work focuses on applying mathematical modeling and robotic control concepts using Python and ROS2.

## Contents

1. Forward and Inverse Kinematics Assignment  
   - Implementation and analysis of FK and IK concepts  
   - Matrix-based transformations and coordinate frame calculations  

2. TurtleSim (Sheepdog) Simulation Assignment  
   - Motion control logic implemented using ROS2  
   - Practical application of coordinate transformations  

3. Demo Video  
   - Screen recording demonstrating the implementation and simulation results  

## Tools Used

- Python  
- ROS2  
- TurtleSim  

This work reflects my interest in robotics, mathematical modeling, and computational problem solving.
